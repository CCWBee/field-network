Break this project down into sprints and tasks. How would you do it?

Notes:
- Do NOT include timeline information, it does not matter.
- Every task/ticket must be an atomic, committable piece of work.
- Each task/ticket must include tests, or if tests do not make sense, another clear form of validation proving it was completed successfully.
- Every sprint must result in a demoable piece of software that:
  - can be run,
  - can be tested,
  - and can be built on top of in later sprints.
- Be exhaustive, clear, and technical.
- Always focus on small, atomic tasks that compose into a clear sprint goal.

After finishing:
1. Provide a prompt that I can give to a sub-agent to review your sprint plan and suggest improvements.
2. Apply the suggested improvements.
3. When finished applying improvements, output: yoU!

Finally:
- Write the tasks/tickets and sprint plans into a Markdown (.md) file.
